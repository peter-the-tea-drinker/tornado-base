Note to self: when including code from other, open-source projects:

    0) Make sure the license is compatible. 
    1) Initial commit - just the unmodified file + date and link, to establish
history.
    2) Include copyright notices in all derivative files. 
    3) Duplicate "portions copyright" notice in the LICENSE file.
    4) Link back to the original.

Paste in:

# Copyright (c) Me, year.
#
# my license
#
# Derived from (link), at (project link), retrieved (date)
#
# Portions copyright (c) <original authors>, <date>
#
