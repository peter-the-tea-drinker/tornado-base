refund of any amounts previously paid to {{ mycompany }}.

version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website will be
governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its
conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes
arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and

intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent
court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this
Agreement shall be finally settled 
with either <strong>flintlock pistols at 10 paces</strong>
 or (at the discretion of {{ mycompany }})
in accordance with the
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in
accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San
Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral
decision may be enforced in any court. 
The prevailing party in any
action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to
costs, and attorneys’ fees. If any part of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the
parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in
full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or
condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one
instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent
breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any
party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and
conditions; {{ mycompany }} may assign its rights under this Agreement
without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure
to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
